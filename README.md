### Hi there, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm the type of person that thinks outside the box. I like to carry that same creativity in my work to create new and exciting concepts.
#### I'm the CEO of Marsandi LLC, a digital agency that provides design and development services for small businesses in the Washington D.C. area. Check us out at: [marsandi.com](https://marsandi.com)
#### In my spare time when I'm not coding I enjoy learning about new tech stacks, frameworks, and other tech related news.
#### By the way, most of my repos are private. So if you're interested in working on something together, let me know!

- I'm currently working on a full MERN stack web application. It's called DrinkUp, coming soon! ðŸ˜„ 
- Iâ€™m currently learning tailwind CSS. Loving the new updates.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm half Latino, half Asian!
- Ask me about blockchain and we'll definitely get a conversation going!
