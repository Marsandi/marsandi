### Hi there, I'm Matt ðŸ‘‹

I'm a creative problem-solver who loves thinking outside the box â€” and sometimes redesigning the box entirely.
Whether it's building something new or optimizing what's already there, I enjoy bringing fresh ideas to the table and turning them into clean, efficient code.

When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'll probably find me exploring new tech stacks, tinkering with frameworks, or staying up to date on the latest in the tech world. ðŸš€

Oh, and most of my repositories are private â€” so if you're curious about what I'm working on or want to collaborate, just reach out!

ðŸŒŒ Also, check out my modern React version of NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day:

It puts a sleek, modern spin on the classic: [apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html](apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html)
